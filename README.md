# Instructions 
For Project 4, we worked as a group to solve, analyze, or visualize a concept using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
3. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. You must use at least two of the following:
  - Python Pandas
  - Python Matplotlib
  - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
  - JavaScript Plotly
  - JavaScript Leaflet
  - SQL Database
  - MongoDB Database
  - Google Cloud SQL
  - Amazon AWS
  - Tableau

For our project we chose to analyze sports betting and create a machine to help accurately predict what bets would be best to place on certain games. In the dataset we used, we analyzed one specific season of the NBA (2017) But the goal is to use our model to be able to predict future NBA games.  This model could be very useful to people interested in sports betting and sports analytics.

To fulfill requirement #5 we chose to use Python Pandas & Tableau. 

# Data
Data for this project came from Kaggle dataset:

# Data Development 
1. Add a column to give us total actual points combined per game
2. Add columns that designated if the winning bet was an over or an under
3. Ignored/dropped columns as necessary
4. Implemented prediction models to see if our machine learning was profitable
